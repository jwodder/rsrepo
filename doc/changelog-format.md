Changelog Format
================

`CHANGELOG.md` is a Markdown file consisting of one or more *sections*, each
one describing a released version.

- Each section begins with a section title followed by a line of three or more
  hyphens.  The section title must be in one of the following formats:

    - `vVERSION (DATE)` (where `DATE` is in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)
    - `vVERSION (in development)`
    - `In Development`

- The remainder of each section after the starting lines is freeform.

- Sections should be separated by blank lines.

- There should be no text before the start of the first section.
